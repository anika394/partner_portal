    <table><tr><td style="border: 1px solid #d3d3d3; padding: 20px;"><p><strong>Dynamic Contracting</strong> - Dynamic Contracting is a flexible and adaptive procurement approach that allows for adjustments and modifications to supplier panels to meet dynamic business needs and circumstances. It emphasizes agility and responsiveness by enabling suppliers to quickly adapt to evolving market conditions and customer requirements, reducing time-to-market. The approach fosters innovation and collaboration, encouraging creative solutions and teamwork between suppliers and agencies for continuous improvement. Additionally, it focuses on cost-efficiency by optimizing resource allocation and reducing waste through alignment of contract terms with actual needs.    </p></td></tr></table>
    
    <table><tr><td style="border: 1px solid #d3d3d3; padding: 20px;"><p><strong>Evergreen Contracting</strong> - Evergreen Contracting involves GovTech establishing selected bulk tenders as long-term agreements that automatically renew at the end of their term unless either party terminates them. This approach includes periodic reviews and adjustments to contract terms to maintain the effectiveness of the contract panel for the Government's needs. It offers continuity and a predictable revenue stream, aiding financial planning and budgeting. Additionally, it reduces efforts required to tender and renegotiate terms with partners and fosters enhanced customer relationships by promoting long-term partnerships and trust with agencies.

    <table><tr><td style="border: 1px solid #d3d3d3; padding: 20px;"><p><strong>Green Procurement</strong> - Starting from FY2024, environmental sustainability considerations will be integrated into Government contracts, with large ICT tenders including up to a 5% weightage for sustainability. This initiative encourages the adoption of sustainable practices, aiming to enhance environmental sustainability and create a greener future for Singapore. It also improves suppliers' reputations by appealing to customers who prioritize green solutions. Moreover, it drives long-term cost savings through efficient resource use and waste reduction, ultimately boosting long-term profitability and competitiveness.</p></td></tr></table>
        
    <table><tr><td style="border: 1px solid #d3d3d3; padding: 20px;"><p><strong>Tender Lite</strong> – The new procurement category, Tender Lite, applies to tenders between $90,000 and $1 million for general goods and services, offering simpler procurement conditions to benefit SMEs. This initiative aims to streamline contract clauses based on associated risks and business needs, and to reduce the cost of transactions with the government through risk-sharing.
    <p></td></tr></table>

    <table><tr><td style="border: 1px solid #d3d3d3; padding: 20px;"><p><strong>IM8 Reform</strong> – IM8 (referring to Instruction Manual for Infocomm Technology & Smart Systems Management) seeks to support agencies in their digital transformation. Recently, in order to better support Singapore’s ambition to become a Smart Nation, there has been an acceleration in the Government’s digital transformation efforts. As such, the IM8 policy reform is an effort to make policy controls lean, relevant, and effective. It introduces significant shifts that aim to ensure quality deliverables on behalf of agencies, the right control measures for developers, and risk identification for central agencies.
