    <h2>Getting Started to Government Procurement</h2>
    <h3>How to Bid</h3>
    <h5>1.     Look out for procurement opportunities
    </h5>
    <p class="indented">To effectively utilize GeBIZ for seeking out opportunities, vendors can begin by regularly monitoring the platform for new tender notices and requests for proposals relevant to their expertise. Vendors may also utilize GeBIZ to gain insights into past procurement exercises, allowing them to understand the government's procurement patterns and preferences, thereby enhancing their strategic approach to securing future opportunities. Additionally, Suppliers can stay updated on new opportunities by subscribing to GeBIZ Business Alerts.    </p>

    <h5>2.     Understand the Terms and Conditions
    </h5>
    <p class="indented">The government agency issuing a Quotation or Tender would also issue its contractual terms and conditions to ensure a level playing field for all potential suppliers. If there are any terms & conditions which remain unclear, it is best to seek clarifications from the procuring agency.
    </p>

    <h5>3.     Understand the Requirements and Criteria    </h5>
    <p class="indented">Quotation and Tender documents contain descriptions of the goods and services to be provided and the criteria to be met. Evaluations of bids are based strictly on the criteria indicated in the Tender document to ensure fairness and transparency. Government agencies do not change evaluation criteria or waive essential requirements or contractual terms during evaluation. Therefore, when submitting Quotation or Tender, always ensure that the evaluation criteria is addressed/fulfilled.<br><br>

        Agencies typically have 2 sets of evaluation criteria:</p>
        
    <li class="indented">Those defined as Critical Criteria – Evaluation criteria that must be met in order for the bid to be considered for award.</li><br>
        
    <li class="indented">Those not defined as Critical Criteria – Suppliers who do not meet these evaluation criteria will still be considered but may be disadvantaged against another supplier that meets the evaluation criteria.</li>
        
    <p class="indented">If there are any requirements and criteria which remain unclear, it is best to seek clarifications with the procuring agency.</p>

    <h5>4.     Attend Tender Briefings or Site Show-rounds
    </h5>
    <p class="indented">Agencies may invite interested suppliers to attend tender briefings or site show-rounds. These briefings are intended to give suppliers greater clarity on the agency’s requirements for the Tender.

    <br><br>Certain Quotations or Tenders may call for interested suppliers to attend mandatory tender briefings or site show-rounds. If so, it will be indicated in the Tender notice. Even where tender briefings or site show-rounds are not mandatory, suppliers are strongly encouraged to attend these briefings to ensure that they have all the necessary information before bids are prepared. It also provides suppliers with the opportunity to seek clarification with the agency on the Quotation or Tender documents, requirements and evaluation criteria
    </p>

    <h5>5.     Apply for Required Accreditations and Qualifications
    </h5>
    <p class="indented">Agencies may require suppliers to have professional qualifications or accreditations to ensure that the products or services delivered conform to industry standards. It will be advantageous for suppliers to find out what qualifications/accreditations are required for their industry and apply for them in advance.

    </p>

    <h5>6.     Ensure that Proposals comply with the Specified evaluation criteria and requirements and are submitted on time.
    </h5>
    <h5>7.     Respond to agencies’ clarification on the submitted proposal, if required.
    </h5>
