                <p>The procurement activities of Ministries, Departments, Organs of State, and Statutory Boards are governed by a set of procurement rules that state the minimum standards they must comply with. Each agency is responsible for making their own procurement decisions and may individually adopt more stringent internal rules on their procurement activities. On occasion, agencies may combine purchases (also known as a “Demand Aggregation”) to enjoy economies of scale and ensure that their procurement provides value-for-money (VFM) to the Government.
                <br><br>
                Government procurement needs vary and range from simple low-value purchases, such as office stationery, to complex multi-million-dollar construction contracts and technology projects. This means that numerous business opportunities exist for all firms to participate as suppliers in government procurement.</p>
