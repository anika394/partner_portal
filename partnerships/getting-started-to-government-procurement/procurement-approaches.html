            <h5>Tender Lite [New]</h5>
            <p class="indented">Tender Lite is a new procurement category aimed at benefiting SMEs for contracts not exceeding S$1,000,000 for general goods and services first. Currently in its experimental stages, we will continue to work with industry partners in crafting Tender Lite for identified project categories and consider feedback on proposed changes, Learn more in our <a href="../additional-resources/upcoming-initiatives.html"><u>Upcoming Initiatives</u></a>.<br><br>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.gebiz.gov.sg/docs/Supplier_Guide_Tender_Lite.pdf"><u>GeBIZ TenderLite Guide</u></a> provides more detailed instructions, FAQs, and best practices to assist industry partners in navigating the GeBIZ system, as well as through integration with AGD (Accountant General’s Department) resources.</p>

            <h5>Demand Aggregation</h5>
            <p class="indented">Demand Aggregation (DA) contracts or ‘Bulk Tenders’ are collective purchases that allow public sector agencies to achieve cost efficiencies and optimize the procurement process. Through this mechanism, GovTech empowers agencies to standardize specifications, maximize economies of scale, and ensure efficient delivery of our services.<br><br>For more information on previous Demand Aggregation contracts and tenders, visit the <a href="https://www.gebiz.gov.sg/"><u>GeBIZ Portal</u></a>.</p>

            <h5>Technical Assessments</h5>
            <p class="indented">Technical Assessments are typically included in quality evaluations done by government agencies for ICT tenders. For the relevant projects covered under this framework, a sample of personnel will undertake the technical assessment during the tender evaluation phase. Those chosen for the assessment must be a part of the project when awarded, and results will affect the quality score of the tenderer. Currently, technical assessments are conducted for <a href="https://www.iss.nus.edu.sg/executive-education/course/detail/ict-assessment-certification-for-solution-architect-/software-systems"><u>Solution Architect</u></a> and <a href="https://www.iss.nus.edu.sg/executive-education/course/detail/ict--assessment-certification-for-software-developer"><u>Software Developer</u></a> roles.
