    <h2>Success Stories</h2>
    <p>The success stories presented exemplify qualities for sustained collaboration with the government, and how a commitment to quality work not only secures initial engagements but also lays the foundation for continued and expanded opportunities within the government procurement landscape:</p>
<table><tr><td style="border: 1px solid #d3d3d3; padding: 20px;">
    <p><strong>GoWhere</strong> - a reusable stack of government portals used in many government initiatives, amassing over 50 million website visits. It was created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which GovTech’s partnership with industry partners was essential to addressing the nation’s urgent needs with agility and innovation. A continued partnership resulted in the co-creation of a self-service portal where agencies can create GoWhere sites without having to code, allowing the team to concentrate on developing new features instead of managing operations. This case demonstrates how successful partnerships may lead to further opportunities for suppliers to expand on their work and develop a positive working relationship with GovTech.

 <table><tr><td style="border: 1px solid #d3d3d3; padding: 20px;">   
    <p><strong>GatherSG</strong> - an engineering and product team that offers bespoke and WOG reusable solutions to help agencies better serve citizens. The 13 bespoke and generic cases systems used across all 85 agencies and the private sector are the result of close partnerships with the vendor’s team, inclusive of delivery managers, designers, software engineers, quality engineer, and tech ops engineers. A combination of field expertise, inter-and-intra collaboration were instrumental in creating such systems, illustrating how integral it is to have qualified personnel and transparency during the development process
    </p></td></tr></table>
<table><tr><td style="border: 1px solid #d3d3d3; padding: 20px;"> 
    <p><strong>OpenCerts</strong> - blockchain for issuing and validating tamper-proof certificates, providing a single place for users to verify certificates issued from any institution. Here, private IT solution providers leveraged GovTech’s OpenAttestation framework to build applications that serve organizations to issue documents in the OpenCerts format. This case exemplifies successful integrations of open-source frameworks that maximise value-for-money.
</p></td></tr></table>
    <table><tr><td style="border: 1px solid #d3d3d3; padding: 20px;">     
    <p><strong>HealthCerts</strong> - a globally inter-operable standard for COVID vaccination, PDT, and Recovery certificates to facilitate the safe resumption of travel. Here, GovTech provided an open-source schema for private IT solution providers to issue PDT HealthCerts. This collaborative approach not only promoted the open use of government digital services, but also demonstrated the efficient and transparent delivery of  HealthCerts to address critical public health needs.
